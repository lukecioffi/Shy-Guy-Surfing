# Shy-Guy-Surfing
My first major game project, developed during nights and weekends while finishing my university studies.

Packages used in development include TextMeshPro, 2D Extras 2019, and Lootlocker SDK.

Since this _was_ my first project, and I have been working on it for over a year while also expanding my Unity knowledge in other ways, you will find that many scripts have more articulate code than others.
